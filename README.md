# Nuremberg Style Solar Clock

**InfiltratorOS clock resource** · **Stable ID:** `nuremberg-solar` · **Module:** `Nuremberg Style Solar Clock.so`

Location-aware modern sunrise/sunset reconstruction of a Nuremberg-style seasonal clock.

**Historical scope/accuracy:** Deliberately distinct from the fixed historical Wendetag schedule.

**Intended installation:** `/System/Resources/Clocks/Nuremberg Style Solar Clock.so` (case-sensitive)

The clock owns both its notation and next-visible-tick scheduling. Its output needs valid geographic coordinates; missing/invalid coordinates are unavailable, not an implicit Greenwich location. Undefined solar crossings at extreme latitudes must be reported as unavailable rather than invented.

## Status

**Source copied and build verified.** This repository contains the implementation of `nuremberg-solar`, the supporting code it needs, a one-provider `Makefile` and focused regression fixtures. The copy is based on Common 1.19.78 at `8d60662114e3`; the original Common source remains unchanged.

Run `make` to produce `build/Nuremberg Style Solar Clock.so` and `make check` to run this provider's checks. No Common checkout or Common archive is required. The current combined Common package and its installation ownership remain in place; this copy does not introduce an independent installer or release.

See [source provenance and build details](SOURCE.md), [source manifest](SOURCE-MANIFEST.json) and [recorded validation](VALIDATION-RESULTS.json).

## Independent forensic audit

See [audit findings](docs/FORENSIC-AUDIT.md) for corrections, numerical-model limits and unresolved authority disagreements. A successful build is not a historical-accuracy certificate.
